What it is:
===========

Playerbot lets you add another character from your account as a bot that you can control and which will hopefully help you. Only characters from your account can be used, so you can have a maximum of 9 bots at one time.

This was taken from the Trinity site, and modified slightly by me to get some of the kinks out. I reworked the priest class and also added a mage class and a warrior class, which are still in crude form. Any class can be used as a bot - just don't expect much in the way of spells or abilities until someone writes the code for them.

Bots will only use abilities that they have - for example, a priest will only use the renew spell if it has been trained. Also, bot's equipment will lose durability like any other character. So every so often you'll need to log in and repair and train your bot.

For Mangos 7800+

Repair with bots:
=================

  The bot(s) can now be repaired, as the player repairs. You can decide whether you wish the bot(s) to pay for
  their own repair or if available, use the guild bank. Choose the appropriate repair 'Anvil' at your local
  NPC. Only group bot(s) members can be repaired. If you wish to exclude certain bot(s) from repair, then
  temporarily uninvite bot(s) from the group.

  Limitations: Bot(s) cannot repair individual items.
               If the player does not require repair, you cannot repair bot(s).

  The new 'stats' command provides useful information to help in the repair decision.

  First:  Money available to bot(s)
  Second: Free inventory slots for bot(s)
  Third:  Estimated (excludes NPC reputation discount) item damage cost for bot(s).

Combat Orders explained:
========================

  There are primary and secondary commands which can be combined. In this way it is
  possible to define a bot to assist the main tank and also protect the healer, making
  combat management much easier.
  The commands assist and protect require a target parameter or a friendly player
  selected by bots master.
  Available Combat Orders:
    tank        pri     try to bind all targets involved in combat by gaining highest threat
    assist      pri     do damage on selected targets attacker without getting highest threat
    heal        pri     concentrate on healing - no offensive spells, try to keep threat low
    protect     sec     if target of protect get's directly attacked gain higher threat on attacker
    reset       -       clear out assist and protect targets and set combat order to nothing
  Examples:
    .bot co TheTank tank
    .bot co MyHealer heal
    .bot co TheBrutal assist TheTank
    .bot co TheBrutal protect MyHealer

Trading with bots:
==================

To trade items/money with your bot simply initiate a trade and the bot will tell you how much money and items are available. To request an item simple whisper the bot and shift click the link of the item you would like. You can link multiple items on the same line. You can also request money in the following manner when the trade window is open:
/w BOTNAME 10g <-- request that the bot give you 10 gold
/w BOTNAME 6g500s25c <-- request 6 gold, 500 silver, and 25 cooper

A bot is also able to show an item in its 'Will not be traded' slot. The item can be either
in its bags or be equipped and even be soulbound. By this you can cast spells/enchantments
on soulbound items ('nt' stands for 'not trading').
/w BOTNAME nt [Powerful Soulbound Item]

More Information:
=================

If specifying a spell substring, the spell chosen will be in priority of exact name match, highest spell rank, and spell using no reagents. Case does not matter. Here's some examples:
/t BOTNAME c greater heal
/t BOTNAME cast pain
/w BOTNAME c poly
/w BOTNAME cast fort
/t BOTNAME cast <SPELLID>
- OR -
/w BOTNAME c <SPELLID>

Also all commands can be broadcast to the party. For example:
/p follow
/p spells

To use or equip items for your bot say:
/w BOTNAME use <ITEMLINK1> <ITEMLINK2>
/w BOTNAME equip <ITEMLINK1> <ITEMLINK2>
- OR -
/w BOTNAME u <ITEMLINK1> <ITEMLINK2>
/w BOTNAME e <ITEMLINK1> <ITEMLINK2>

If you inspect your bot, your bot will tell you what items you have in your inventory that you can equip. To create a link in the chat window, hold the shift key and press the left mouse button when clicking the link.


Changes from Trinity to Mangos:
===============================

I added the following in SharedDefines.h.

enum SpellCategory
{
	SPELL_CATEGORY_FOOD             = 11,
	SPELL_CATEGORY_DRINK            = 59
};

I also had to add the following to Player.h:

enum PlayerStateType
{
	PLAYER_STATE_NONE              = 0,
	PLAYER_STATE_SIT               = 1
};


Configuration variables:
========================
Also see src/mangosd/mangosd.conf.dist for configuration variables!

    PlayerbotAI.DebugWhisper
        Enable debug output by whispering master
        Default: 0 - off
                 1 - on

    PlayerbotAI.FollowDistanceMin
    PlayerbotAI.FollowDistanceMax
        Min. and max. follow distance for bots
        Default: 0.5 / 1.0


Some Problems:
==============

The bots don't always face in the right direction. Sometimes when a bot makes the kill, the corpse is not lootable. The mage bot sometimes get stuck when he begins to cast a spell (but this is corrected the next time he enters combat).
