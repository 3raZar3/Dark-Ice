::Quick_OUT_LOOK::

Us Here at DARK_iCE stride to bring you the best Core we can as this core was built from collecting/editting and writing
Code for varoius soucres and varoius repo's around git as well as the player's input and patches
one day we hope to have a core that is as close to blizz-like as possible
please remember that this is our own time we use to make and build this  we do not get paid for this
so please keep this in mind  as well as we are all still learning here
